\begin{frame}{Un exemple en discrimination (classification)}

      Ici, la réponse $Y$ est \mybold{ qualitative}.

      \exemple
      $\mathcal{Y} = \{\texttt{spam},  \texttt{ham}\}$
      (\texttt{ham}=e-mail correct) ou bien
      $\mathcal{Y}= \{0, 1, \dots,9\}$. Les objectifs peuvent être
      \begin{itemize}
      \item construire un classifieur $\phi(x)$ qui assigne une nouvelle
        observation $x$ à l'une des classes dans $\mathcal{Y}$
      \item évaluer l'incertitude sur cette classification \footfullcite{Massias_Gramfort_Salmon18}
      \item comprendre les rôles de $X^{(1)}$, \dots, $X^{(p)}$
      \end{itemize}

      \begin{equation*}
          \phi^*(x) = \argmax_{y\in \mathcal{Y}} P(Y=y|X=x)
      \end{equation*}
      pour la perte  $l(y,y')=1_{y\neq y'}$.

      \vspace{1cm}

      On peut toujours utiliser une méthodes
      des plus proches voisins pour la construction d'une règle de classification  $\widehat{\phi}(x)$ à partir de $d_1^n$.

      Autres méthodes:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item régression logistique / analyse linéaire discriminante
      \item modèles additifs généralisés
      \item \emph{Support Vector Machine} (SVM)
