# Good Scientific Writing Practice

## Images

1. Use images that you created whenever you can.

2. If you don't know how to create a figure (well [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) should be enough thoug in most cases), borrow it and cite the source. Favor CreativeCommons ones, see for instance ressources at
https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/


## Latex rules

1. Tools for Latex: Table generator http://www.tablesgenerator.com/ and  OCR for Latex formulas https://mathpix.com/

2. **Warning** font style :
```math
SNR \neq $SNR$
```

3. Add space on which you optimize:
```math
\min_{x \in X}
```
is **good**,
```math
\min_{x}
```
is *forbidden*.

4. **Always use**  *\enspace* at the of align/equation environments; e.g., :
```math
\begin{align}
x + 3 \enspace.
\end{align}
```
and not
```math
\begin{align}
x + 3.
\end{align}


## English rules
1. **HARMONIZE notation**
1. isn't -> **is not**, can't -> **can not**, let's -> **let us**
1. **Do not use** "I", "my". **Use** "royal", "we".
1. **Never** start a sequence by a formula.
1. **Use . , ;** at the end of a formula.
1. **Refrain** for using "will".
1. "permit" no so popular, **use** "allow".
1. **Number should often be a letter**: "3 times larger" -> "three times larger"
1. Notation without **s** for math.
1. Present tense, third person: "he, she, it", **add* an "s" at the end.

1. **Define** (almost) all "symbols you use".
1. **Define** concepts in correct order.
