\begin{definition}[Strong convexity]
A function $f$ is said $\lambda$-strongly convex if the function
$\left(f - \lambda \norm{\cdot}^2\right)$ is convex.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The norm used in this document is always the Euclidean norm: $\norm{\,\cdot\,} = \norm{\,\cdot\,}_2$.
\end{remark}


\begin{proposition}
The function $f$ is $\lambda$-strongly convex if and only if $
\forall w_1 w_2, \forall \alpha \in [0,1]:$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:strong}
f\left(\alpha w_1 + (1-\alpha) w_2\right)
\leq
\alpha f(w_1) + (1-\alpha) f(w_2) - \lambda \alpha (1-\alpha) \norm{w_1-w_2}^2
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}


We will then use $w^{(\alpha)}$ to denote $\alpha w_1 + (1-\alpha) w_2$.

\begin{proof}
Firstly, we remark that for all $\alpha \in [0,1]$,
$$ \norm{w^{(\alpha)}}^2 = \alpha^2\norm{w_1}^2 + (1-\alpha)^2\norm{w_2}^2 + 2 \alpha (1-\alpha) \scal{w_1}{w_2}$$
Then, we prove the equivalence of the two statements.
$f$ is strongly convex if and only if the following inequality is valid for all $\alpha \in [0,1]$.
\begin{equation*}
f(w^{(\alpha)}) - \lambda \norm{w^{(\alpha)}}^2 \leq  \alpha f(w_1) + (1-\alpha) f(w_2) - \lambda \left( \alpha \norm{w_1}^2 + (1-\alpha)\norm{w_2}^2\right)\\
\end{equation*}
Then, by replacing $\norm{w^{(\alpha)}}$ by its expression, we obtain:
\begin{equation*}
f(w^{(\alpha)}) \leq \alpha f(w_1) + (1-\alpha) f(w_2) -
 \lambda \left( \left(\alpha-\alpha^2\right) \norm{w_1}^2 +\left((1-\alpha)-(1-\alpha)^2\right)\norm{w_2}^2 + 2 \alpha(1-\alpha)\scal{w_1}{w_2}\right)
\end{equation*}
By reducing and factorizing, we get the following inequalities
\begin{equation*}
f(w^{(\alpha)}) \leq \alpha f(w_1) + (1-\alpha) f(w_2) -
 \lambda \alpha (1-\alpha) \left( \norm{w_1}^2 +\norm{w_2}^2 - 2 \scal{w_1}{w_2}\right)
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}
