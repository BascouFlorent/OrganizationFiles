This repository provides elements and guidelines for writing scientific documents (TeX, BibTeX and Python especially) for researchers and professor, but mostly for people in my lab.

## TeX / LaTeX / BibTeX
In the [LaTeX section](tex/README.md) is provided:

## Python
In section [draft-package](python/draft-package/README.md) 
an example of a Python package
 to start a new project.
If you are looking for more help on (scientific) Python I can only recommend my course with [B. Charlier](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~charlier), see: https://github.com/bcharlier/HMMA238 


## Inkscape
In the [Inkscape](inkscape/README.md) section, I am giving some insights on why **Inkscape** is an incredible tool to master for a PhD student or a modern researcher. 


## Advice (mostly) for PhD students
In section [guidelines](guidelines/README.md), standard information and work practices for working in my the group is provided. Information on summer schools, fundings tips for traveling, etc. is also given.
