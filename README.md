This repository provides elements and guidelines for writing scientific documents (TeX, BibTeX and Python especially) for researchers and professor, but mostly for people in my lab.
To use it, it is recommended to fork the repository by clicking **Fork** in the top-right corner of the page.


## TeX and BibTeX
In the [TeX/LaTeX section](tex/REAMDE.md) is provided:

- References harmonized for my group in (a huge) .bib file: [references_all.bib](tex/biblio/references_all.bib)

- Snippets used for LaTeXing with Sublime (to be adapted for VSCode).

- TeX templates and examples for:

### File examples
Articles [article.tex](tex/draft-article/article.tex), Slides [beamer.tex](tex/draft-beamer/beamer.tex), Exams [exam.tex](tex/draft-exam/exam.tex), Scribe notes in classroom [scribe.tex](tex/draft-scribe/scribe.tex)

## Python
In section [draft-package](python/draft-package/README.md) 
an example of a Python package
 to start a new project.
If you are looking for more help on (scientific) Python I can only recommend my course with B. Charlier, see: https://github.com/bcharlier/HMMA238 


## Inkscape
In section [inkscape](inkscape/README.md), I am giving some insights on why **inkscape** is an incredible tool to master for a PhD student or a modern researcher. 


## Advice (mostly) for PhD students
In section [guidelines](guidelines/README), standard information and work practices for working in my the group is provided. Information on summer schools, fundings tips for traveling, etc. is also given.
