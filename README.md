# OrganizationFiles

This repository provides elements and guidelines for writing scientific documents (TeX, BibTeX and Python especially) for researchers and professor, but mostly for people in my lab.
To use it, it is recommended to fork the repository by clicking **Fork** in the top-right corner of the page.


## TeX and BibTeX

- References harmonized for my group in (a huge) .bib file: [references_all.bib](tex/biblio/references_all.bib)

- Snippets used for LaTeXing with Sublime (to be adapted for VSCode).

- TeX templates and examples for:

### File examples

## Python
Here is provided an example of a Python package: [draft-package](python/draft-package/README.md) to start a new project.


## Advice for (mostly) PhD students
This is mostly for people in my group, but could be helpful for others. This includes standard information for working in the group, but also summer schools, fundings tips for traveling, etc.
